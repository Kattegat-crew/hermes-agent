# Campaign Publish Automation (calendario → aprobación → publicación → métricas)

End-to-end pattern for automating a marketing content calendar where **a human owns approval and scripts own
execution**. Built and verified in production 08/09/2026 for the NeuralCrew bingo-sep2026 campaign (Golden Game +
Lucky Brothers, IG+FB), in repo `marketing-campaign-generator/planning/calendario-sep2026/`. Complements the
how-to-publish skill `composio-social-publishing` and the how-to-measure skill `content-performance-analytics`.

## Architecture: three surfaces, one source of truth

1. **JSONL in the git repo = truth.** One row per piece: `id, brand, type, asset_drive_id, cover_drive_id, copy,
   hashtags_ig/fb, canales, slot (ISO), estado, aprobacion, media_ids, portal_url`. Diffable, auditable, consumable
   by scripts. Never let the calendar live only in a spreadsheet or in chat memory.
2. **XLSX generated from JSONL → Drive campaign folder = human review surface.** Hyperlinks per row to the piece
   (portal/Drive). The admin edits copy/hashtags/estado **there** ("yo edito la tabla, tú actualizas los otros
   lados"). Re-upload must **replace in place (same Drive file ID)** so existing links never break.
3. **Sync script XLSX(Drive)→JSONL** downloads the latest XLSX, diffs cell-by-cell, propagates human edits,
   commits. Run it on EVERY publisher tick, not just the morning package — an approval written at 9 AM must make
   the 11 AM slot.

## State machine (the safety core)

`listo_para_aprobacion` → human OK (chat "Dale <id>" or Estado cell = `Aprobado` in the XLSX) → `aprobado` →
publisher cron fires at slot → `publicado` (+media_ids) → metrics harvest in following days. `a_producir` =
planned production gap.

**Hard rule: the publisher ONLY touches `aprobado` rows. Nothing external is ever posted without an explicit
human gate.** Add an anti-double-publish guard: a row that already carries `media_ids` gets flipped to `publicado`
without re-posting (covers "published but git commit failed").

## The cron trio (Hermes, validated)

| Cron | Schedule | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `calendario-paquete-diario` | 7:30 AM | sync XLSX→JSONL + today's pieces + pending approvals + recent metrics → WhatsApp package. Agent formats the script's structured stdout; "Nada pendiente hoy" is a valid reply |
| `calendario-publicacion-horaria` | every hour | publish ONLY `aprobado` rows inside slot ±2h window; register media_ids; regenerate XLSX+dashboards; git commit/push; announce successes. Stdout = only human-actionable lines (`✔ PUBLICADO id: IG=… FB=…`); JSON detail to stderr; silent return when nothing due |
| `calendario-metricas-diario` | 6:00 AM (no_agent) | harvest IG+FB insights per brand account → posts.jsonl → dashboards |

Script-path guard note: `script` fields (CLI and `cronjob_manage`) only accept paths under HERMES_HOME/scripts.
Pattern: logic lives versioned in the repo; the scripts dir holds a 3-line wrapper `#!/bin/bash` + `exec python3
/ruta/repo/.../cron_x.py`. `chmod +x` it, and smoke-run `bash <wrapper>` in foreground **before** creating the job.

## Publishing mechanics (what each type needs, verified live)

- **Assets need a public URL Meta can fetch** (IG strictly): host on the portal's SSO-exempt asset path (e.g.
  `reels.neuralcrewlabs.com/assets/<mes>/`), verify with curl before use. Beware Cloudflare caching a 404 on fresh
  uploads → cache-buster `?v=<epoch>`.
- **IG**: two-step — create media container (REELS/STORIES/CAROUSEL; single image: omit media_type) then publish.
  Reels: `cover_url` + `share_to_feed` so it also lands on the grid. Stories: only via IG — **FB has no stories
  publishing API; don't fake it, label the channel difference in the calendar.**
- **FB**: `FACEBOOK_CREATE_VIDEO_POST` / `FACEBOOK_CREATE_PHOTO_POST` / `FACEBOOK_CREATE_MULTI_PHOTO_POST`
  (carousel = array of photo_url). **Local file upload 413s on ~100MB+ videos → use `file_url` pointing at the
  same public portal URL.**
- **Carousels IG**: create child containers in order, then parent `CAROUSEL` with `children` ids.
- **Multiple brands = one Composio connection each**: resolve account IDs once via Composio tooling and store them
  in the publish script (per-brand dict), not in chat memory.

## Metrics harvest gotchas (each cost a debugging cycle)

- IG insights parameter is **`ig_media_id`** — `media_id` returns a validation error.
- Requesting a single deprecated metric name (`replies`, `follows`, `link_clicks`, `reels_skip_rate`) **fails the
  entire insights call** — request only the currently-valid list: `views, reach, likes, comments, saved, shares,
  total_interactions`.
- Insights work below 1,000 followers (verified on small brand accounts) — the docs' limit is statistical, not a
  hard API gate.
- Scripts calling the Composio CLI from the cron environment may need `COMPOSIO=$(which composio)` exported —
  hardcoded container paths break across host/container boundaries.

## Cadence design lessons (content side)

- Fixed weekly template beats ad-hoc planning: Lunes reel 11:00 · Martes–Domingo story 12:00 M (1/día, en orden
  de historia) · Jueves post estático 11:00 · Viernes story temática del día ancla 17:00 · Sábado carrusel 11:00.
- **Stories live 24h, not 12h** — at 1/day exactly one is ever live; don't double-publish to "show two".
- The anchor day of the promotion (viernes de bingo) gets the themed story; teaser reels land 2–3 days before it.
- Inventory existing assets BEFORE planning production — week 1 can be 100% covered at zero production cost if a
  Drive inventory (taxonomized Reels/Posts/Stories/Carruseles) exists. Build it with drive IDs; they become the
  `asset_drive_id` column.

## Failure handling

Publisher errors exit with the error text in stdout → chat notification, and the row stays `aprobado` (not
consumed), so the next hourly tick retries automatically. Use generous script timeouts: ≥560s for harvest /
≥400s for publishing (large video uploads).

## Verification checklist before trusting the automation

- [ ] dry-run mode publishes nothing but prints the plan; ran on a live row.
- [ ] Foreground smoke of every cron wrapper done (publish-due silent when nothing due).
- [ ] Anti-double guard exercised (row with media_ids never re-posts).
- [ ] `cronjob_manage list`: all jobs `scheduled`, next_run_at populated, correct deliver targets.
- [ ] First real package + first real publish verified by reading back the live feeds.
